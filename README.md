# Pull-Requests
A brief explanation/write-up on the nitty-grity of pull requests.ðŸ“–

In Git, a pull request is a feature that allows developers to propose changes to a repository and request that someone review and merge those changes into the main branch. It serves as a way to facilitate collaboration and maintain a controlled workflow when working with Git repositories, especially in a team setting.

Here's a simple scenario where a pull request can be implemented:

1. Forking a Repository: Let's say you want to contribute to an open-source project hosted on GitHub. You start by forking the project's repository, which creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. Creating a Branch: Once you have the forked repository, you create a new branch in your forked repository. This branch will contain the changes you want to make to the project.

3. Making Changes: In your local environment, you make the necessary code changes or additions to the files in the branch. These changes can be related to fixing a bug, implementing a new feature, or improving existing code.

4. Committing Changes: After making the desired changes, you commit them to your branch. Each commit represents a logical unit of change with a commit message describing the purpose of the commit.

5. Pushing Changes: Once you have made one or more commits, you push the branch with the commits to your forked repository on GitHub. This updates the branch in your remote repository with the latest changes.

6. Creating a Pull Request: At this point, you navigate to your forked repository on GitHub and create a pull request. You specify the branch with your changes as the source branch and the original repository's branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) as the target branch. You provide a title and description for the pull request, explaining the purpose of the changes.

7. Review and Discussion: Other developers or project maintainers review the pull request. They can provide feedback, ask questions, or suggest modifications to the code. This discussion happens within the context of the pull request, allowing for collaborative feedback and iteration.

8. Making Changes and Updating the Pull Request: Based on the feedback received, you can make additional commits and push them to the branch in your forked repository. The pull request is automatically updated with the new changes, facilitating further review and discussion.

9. Merge and Close: Once the pull request is reviewed and approved, a project maintainer merges the changes into the main repository's branch. The pull request is then closed, indicating that the proposed changes have been successfully incorporated.

By following this process, pull requests provide a structured and collaborative way to contribute changes to a Git repository. They promote code review, discussion, and a controlled integration of changes into the main branch of a project.

Note that this is just a simplified overview, and the exact workflow may vary depending on the project, the tools used, and the specific Git hosting platform.
