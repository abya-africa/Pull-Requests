# Pull-Requests
A brief explanation/write-up on the nitty-grity of pull requests.üìñ

In Git, a pull request is a feature that allows developers to propose changes to a repository and request that someone review and merge those changes into the main branch. It serves as a way to facilitate collaboration and maintain a controlled workflow when working with Git repositories, especially in a team setting.

Here's a simple scenario where a pull request can be implemented:

1. Forking a Repository: Let's say you want to contribute to an open-source project hosted on GitHub. You start by forking the project's repository, which creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. Creating a Branch: Once you have the forked repository, you create a new branch in your forked repository. This branch will contain the changes you want to make to the project.

3. Making Changes: In your local environment, you make the necessary code changes or additions to the files in the branch. These changes can be related to fixing a bug, implementing a new feature, or improving existing code.

4. Committing Changes: After making the desired changes, you commit them to your branch. Each commit represents a logical unit of change with a commit message describing the purpose of the commit.

5. Pushing Changes: Once you have made one or more commits, you push the branch with the commits to your forked repository on GitHub. This updates the branch in your remote repository with the latest changes.

6. Creating a Pull Request: At this point, you navigate to your forked repository on GitHub and create a pull request. You specify the branch with your changes as the source branch and the original repository's branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) as the target branch. You provide a title and description for the pull request, explaining the purpose of the changes.

7. Review and Discussion: Other developers or project maintainers review the pull request. They can provide feedback, ask questions, or suggest modifications to the code. This discussion happens within the context of the pull request, allowing for collaborative feedback and iteration.

8. Making Changes and Updating the Pull Request: Based on the feedback received, you can make additional commits and push them to the branch in your forked repository. The pull request is automatically updated with the new changes, facilitating further review and discussion.

9. Merge and Close: Once the pull request is reviewed and approved, a project maintainer merges the changes into the main repository's branch. The pull request is then closed, indicating that the proposed changes have been successfully incorporated.

By following this process, pull requests provide a structured and collaborative way to contribute changes to a Git repository. They promote code review, discussion, and a controlled integration of changes into the main branch of a project.

Note that this is just a simplified overview, and the exact workflow may vary depending on the project, the tools used, and the specific Git hosting platform.


## Feature Branch Workflowüßë‚Äçüè≠
Branching workflows in Git provide a structured approach to managing code changes and collaborating on projects. Pull requests play a crucial role in facilitating code review and integrating changes from one branch to another. Let's explore a common branching workflow, known as the "Feature Branch Workflow," and the corresponding Git commands involved.

Feature Branch Workflow:
1. Create a New Branch: Start by creating a new branch for the feature or task you're working on. This branch will isolate your changes from the main development branch.

```shell
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```

2. Make Changes and Commit: Make your desired code changes within the new branch and commit them.

```shell
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Implement feature XYZ"
```

3. Push the Branch: Push the branch with your commits to the remote repository.

```shell
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

4. Open a Pull Request: On the repository's hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), open a pull request to merge your feature branch into the main branch.

5. Review and Discuss: Collaborators or project maintainers review your pull request, provide feedback, and discuss the proposed changes. This process can include discussions, suggestions, and improvements to ensure code quality.

6. Make Changes and Update the Pull Request: If changes are requested during the review process, make the necessary updates within your feature branch and push the changes to the remote repository. The pull request will automatically update with the new commits.

```shell
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Address feedback from code review"
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

7. Merge the Pull Request: Once the pull request is approved and ready to be merged, you can merge it into the main branch. This integrates your changes into the main codebase.

8. Clean up: After the pull request is merged, you can delete the feature branch, as it has served its purpose.

```shell
git branch -d feature/my-feature
```

The Feature Branch Workflow allows for a clear separation of changes, encourages collaboration and code review, and ensures that the main branch remains stable and reliable. It's a widely used branching model in Git-based projects.

Remember, the specific Git commands provided in this explanation assume that you're using the command-line interface. Git hosting platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket also offer user-friendly interfaces to perform these actions, including creating pull requests and merging changes.

## Fun Factüåù
The largest pull request ever made on GitHub was a massive 2.6 million lines of code! It was submitted by a user named Pavel Vasilyev and contained changes to the text processing software called ASpell. This pull request was so large that it took several hours to process and caused some performance issues on GitHub's backend systems. Eventually, the pull request was closed without being merged, but it serves as a reminder of the scale and complexity that pull requests can reach. It's a testament to the flexibility and scalability of pull requests as a collaboration mechanism in large software projects.
